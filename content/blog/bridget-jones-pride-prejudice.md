The other night I was kept up worrying about an imaginary situation where I was forced to choose between BJD (Bridget Jones’s Diary) and Pride and Prejudice to eliminate off the face of the Earth. I will probably never personally be put in this situation, but here are some of the points of consideration I drew up in case they ever become important later.

Will it be just the books that get deleted? Or the movies. If movies too, Bridget Jones’s Diary should probably go because Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly is in the top 10 movies of all time.

Dani pointed out that Pride and Prejudice is used for “computational text analysis”, and is thus maybe important for science in some way. But I pointed out that you could just swap Pride and Prejudice for Bridge Jones’s Diaries.

Colin Firth plays Mr. Darcy in both movies, though I haven’t seen the Pride and Prejudice he is in.

F. R. Leavis says Jane Austen is one of Britain’s 4 great novelists, but F.R. Leavis had already died before Jones’s Diary came out, and he did not have the opportunity to see any of the movies, so I am not sure if he had all the information to make a judgement like we do now.

Hugh Grant makes the perfect Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham’s hair is too long in the other adaptations. It’s a horse girl ponytail tie with a ribbon, and it’s made women insecure about their low ponytails for a generation. This is a huge issue because the low ponytail is the only ponytail that doesn’t make your scalp hurt.

Pride and Prejudice the book does not contain any information at the beginning of the chapter about how many cigarettes Elizabeth smoked that day, and what weird foods she consumed. This, I feel is crucial information. The fact that Jane Austen left that out leads me to believe she did not understand the kind of content I would like, or the psyche of women in general.
