The name for *The Garden of Earthly Delights* came to me as a joke while I was coming up with ideas in my journal for my blog. It took me a few months to remember that the name is from this 16th Century painting by Hieronymus Bosch. A few months ago, I spend a long time looking at the high res version on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights#/media/File:The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg) while I should have been resolving issues at work. The triptych depicts a surrealist Garden of Eden, the perils and joy of life's temptations and the contrast between what is natural and what is created.

Naturally, inside each of our spirits lives this very garden. But, this blog is more than the humanity we nurture in quiet, still moments. It is fundamentally a work blog. I am a worker, and I have lots of thoughts about work â€“ improvements that can be made, adjustments, etc. I ask if you disagree with my blog on first read, read it twice, and then a third time. Then, share it, both online, with your closest friends and family, and finally to itself.

Each post will not only be available via the world wide web, but I will also be printing out a physical copy and stapling it to the sign outside my house each week. Though we are digital workers, we should not limit our work to the digital realm. This breeds separation and turmoil in society.

I will not be accepting solicitations for advice for this blog. I created an email address for it solicitations@earthly-delights.net, but I automatically route any mail received to it to the trash can. Additionally, the mail is printed, but then immediately shredded by my receptionist (who is also my cousin).

I invite you to take a look at the painting above for a really really long time, and if afterwords you feel like coming back, you are cordially invited to do so.
