The name for The Garden of Earthly Delights came to me as a joke while I was coming up with ideas in my journal for my blog. It took me a few months to realize that the name is from this 16th Century painting by Hieronymus Bosch. A few months ago, I spend a long time looking at the high res version on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights#/media/File:The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg). The triptych depicts a surrealist Garden of Eden and the perils and joy of life's temptations, and the contrasts of what is natural and what is created. 

That is not at all what this blog is about. This blog is a tech blog from someone who venemently hates the tech world.
