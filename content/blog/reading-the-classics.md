For those who don't know, a few years back I decided I was going to read all of the classics. I spent the better part of the last four years working my way through them. I have a blog over at [boringbooks.org](boringbooks.org) where I informally review each of the books I read and my experience with them.

I have been meaning to write something larger about my experience working on this project. It's hard to even think of the project as a "project" in any way because it became such a big part of my life and formed such a huge part of my identity that it feels now like something inseparable from everyday life. 

 But an art project it was, and a very time consuming one. For two years straight, I read for 30 minutes every morning and 30 minutes every night. If it was a real snorer, sometimes I would dedicate an hour in the middle of the day to knock out a chunk, reading until my skin crawled. It doesn't sound like much, but to observers at the time I was basically constantly reading. 

At about year three, my pace slowed way down. *Middlemarch*, which is my all time favorite book, had a really dull couple hundred page section in the middle where they hash out local politics. I picked up Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* right after, which required simultaneously following a college lecture while reading. I think that is what finally took the wind out of my sails. I do feel like it is a project that I am still actively working on, but at a certain point you have to chill out. I read in the mornings a couple of times a week.

When you work on something for 3+ years, the meaning of it changes so many times that it ceases to be even one thing. The project was born out of lackluster intentions. I never read the Iliad and the Odyssey in college. My mind was really full with a lot of young people things, and I would sit on the couch in my apartment and try to get through it, and the words would not stick. I think I had felt like I had failed when I didn't read it (I also literally failed the class), and somewhere deep I wondered if there were things that were not meant for me. 

This feeling grew inside of me and finally I couldn't take it anymore. It turns out the hard part of the Iliad is only the first five pages, and then it starts making sense. That could have saved 19-year-old me quite a lot of anguish if I had known that. My professor probably mentioned something in class, but I couldn't understand him because he was the dustiest person of all time, literally could have been Homer's older brother. 

Three days into the project, I finished both of those poems, all those feelings of shame evaporated out of my body, and the entire purpose of the project changed. I realized that I was capable of reading anything I wanted to read. I made a huge list of crusty books that I thought it would be interesting to read, and took off working my way through it in chronological order.

I picked books specifically based on their crustiness. I went with the driest, most reductive version of the Canon. I wanted to know what all the old dudes had to say. 

After I finished each book, I would write notes on it as reference for this blog post. Unfortunately, rereading the notes, most of them ended up being descriptions of the weather on the days I read the books. I don't know how anyone can take seriously writing notes on a book. I spend a lot of time wondering how things like Stanfords Plato philosophy archive, or Wikipedia summaries can exist. 

It's not hyperbolic to say the project changed me in the most important way, which is it gave me self-confidence and trust in what I had to say. It feels like such an important change that it is hard to quantify. I am proud to have been able to look at an old feeling that haunted me and to make it into something new. 

Not all of it was really as boring as I pretend it was. Augustine, literally gifted me with a sense of religious faith that I had never ever considered in my life. *Middlemarch* (a snoozer) is my all time favorite book, George Eliot reaches out to me from the past and pats my poor nervous soul on the shoulder. I read it over and over, just opening to random pages. Adam Smith and Hume, I feel like I have a personal, intimate connection with. After finishing each of their biggest tombs, I visited their actual tombs in Edinburgh. 

Books I hated: Plato seems like the most annoying dude who ever lived. No one talks about that. I bet he was absolutely insufferable to be around. I'm also sorry to say, T.S Eliot, I am sure you were a nice guy, but I feel like all of his contributions to the world are really annoying (except for Djuna Barnes Nightwood).
