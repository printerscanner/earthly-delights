I've been meaning to write something about what it meant to spend the last few years reading my way through the classics. It's hard to think of the project a "project" in any way because it became such a big part of my life and formed such a huge part of my identity that it began to feel like less of a project and more a very large piece of me. 

When you work on something for 3+ years, the meaning of it changes so many times that it ceases to be even one thing. The project was born out of lackluster intentions. I never read the Iliad and the Odyssey in college. My mind was really full with a lot of young people things, and I would sit on the couch in my apartment and try to get through it, and the words would not stick. I think I had felt like I had failed when I didn't read it (I also literally failed the class), and somewhere deep I wondered if there were things that were not meant for me. 

This feeling grew so big inside of me and finally I couldn't take it anymore. It turns out the hard part of the Iliad is only the first five pages, and then it starts making sense. That could have saved 19 year old me quite a lot of anguish if I had known that. My professor probably mentioned something in class, but I couldn't understand him because he was the dustiest person of all time, literally could have been Homer's older brother. 

3 days into the project, I finished both of those poems, all those feelings left my body, and the entire purpose of the project changed. I realized that yes, I was capable of reading anything I wanted to read. I made a huge list of crusty books that I thought it would be interesting to read, and took off working my way through it in chronological order.

After I finished each book, I would write notes on it as reference for this blog post. Unfortunately, rereading the notes, most of them ended up being descriptions of the weather on the days I read the books, which are nostalgic mementos for me and entirely worthless for this blog post. 

Somehow, I stayed extremely consistent with this project. For two years straight, I read for 30 minutes every morning and 30 minutes every night. If it was a real snorer, sometimes I would dedicate an hour in the middle of the day to knock out a chunk, reading until my skin crawled. 

I lost momentum in the summer of 2022. I read a couple of really long ones. *Middlemarch*, which is my all time favorite book, had a really dull couple hundred page section in the middle of the novel where they hash out local politics. I read Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* which required simultaneously following a college lecture while reading. I think that is what finally took the wind out of my sails. But mostly, I just feel less pressure. I read in the mornings a couple of times a week. 

It's not hyperbolic to say the project changed me in the most important way, which is it gave me self-confidence and trust in what I had to say. It feels like such an important change that it is hard to quantify. I am proud to have been able to look at an old feeling that haunted me and to make it into something new. 

I have a blog over at boringbooks.org where I talk about each book I read and my experience with it. Not all of it was really as boring as I pretend it was. Augustine, literally gifted me with a sense of religious faith that I had never ever considered in my life. *Middlemarch* (a snoozer) is my all time favorite book, George Eliot reaches out to me from the past and pats my poor nervous soul on the shoulder. I read it over and over, just opening to random pages. 

Books I hated: Plato seems like the most annoying dude who ever lived. No one talks about that. I bet he was absolutely insufferable to be around. I'm also sorry to say, T.S Eliot, I am sure you were a nice guy, but your your poems STINK.
