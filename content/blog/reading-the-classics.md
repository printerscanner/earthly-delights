In the last few months while pursuing my new hobby of scrolling instagram reels of ultramarathoners, David Goggins speeches and mens rights activists new to bodybuilding, I've learned that people only start something hard because they feel guilty, and only continue with it it because they feel shame. I started reading the classics because I felt really bad that I hadn't done all of my assigned reading in school, and like the total goody two-shoes I am, I had to come back and finish all of it. 

With basically three years of continuous effort, I read a big percentage of the major works of the Western Canon and a significant portion of my to-read list. I have another entire blog dedicated to this, called the [boring books blog](https://boringbook.org). The whole blog is a little haphazard, it mostly consists of some general and sometimes unrelated thoughts I had while reading the book. One big takeaway from that blog was the realization that usually I remember the actual contents of the book less than what the weather was like the day I was reading the book. 

One more related thought about the boring books blog that I have never mentioned. There is a lot of huff in the book world about finishing books. People, especially when reading the classics like to think that reading an excerpt is equivalent to having read the whole book. I think that's both unacceptable, and how they get you. Adam Smith is a great example here. Most assigned reading on Smith covers the first chapter of *The Wealth of Nations*. You can tell that is the only part most people read because all people talk about with him is how wonderful the Division of Labor is. Especially as you get into the 15th and 16th Century, a lot of these authors are publicly characterized by one or two ideas (ideas which are usually introduced in the first chapter), and to only read a small excerpts m....

If there is a book listed as read on the list, that means I actually read the entire book. That means that there are a bunch of books that aren't on that list because I made it a hundred pages in and lost my will to live. 

But, I have been meaning for years to write something longer about the experience of reading all these books, and about the extremely contentious topic of the classics.
