Developers are not usually considered champions of UX. However, there are a few pitfalls we commonly find propagated by well intentioned designers.

## **Scroll Takeover**

One of the primary goals of UX design is to provide users with a sense of control. The "Scroll Takeover" effect, where the website takes control of the user's scrolling, can be frustrating. Users expect to navigate at their own pace, and these takeovers disrupt that sense of control.

## **Cursor Takeover**

A familiar cursor is like a guiding star for users, helping them navigate the digital landscape. However, when UX elements alter the cursor's appearance or behavior dramatically, users can become disoriented. Developers may need to find ways to make the cursor behavior more intuitive, which adds complexity to the development process.

## **Sideways Scrolling**

Sideways scrolling goes against user expectations for how websites function. While it may seem creative, it can confuse users and disrupt their navigation. Developers are tasked with finding solutions that maintain a smooth and intuitive user experience, even in the presence of unconventional design choices.

## **Infinite Scrolling**

While infinite scrolling can create a seamless browsing experience, it may not be the best choice in every situation. Developers often find that implementing pagination is a more user-friendly option, as it allows users to manage and navigate content more effectively.

## **Modals**

Modal windows can be distracting and frustrating for users, as they interrupt the flow of the user experience. Developers sometimes need to work on implementing these modals in a way that minimizes disruption to ensure a more seamless and enjoyable user journey.

## **Toggle Switches**

UX elements that don't correspond directly to HTML elements and rely heavily on color to distinguish on/off states can be challenging for developers to implement accessibly. Ensuring that these elements are user-friendly and meet accessibility standards can be time-consuming.

## **Color Contrast & Font Size**

While subtle color combinations might look aesthetically pleasing, strong color contrast is essential for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WGAC) compliance. Designers and developers must collaborate to strike a balance between style and accessibility, ensuring that all users can engage with the product effectively.

Small text might look elegant in a design but can pose readability challenges. Developers often need to adjust font sizes to ensure content is clear and legible, even on various devices and screen sizes.

## **Carousels**

Carousels are a popular design choice, but they can be heavy on JavaScript and often lead to important information being hidden off-screen. Developers must work on optimizing the performance and placement of carousels to ensure a seamless and informative user experience.

## **Sort and Search**

Adding sorting and search features to tables and lists is a common UX requirement. While these features enhance usability, they can be technically complex and costly to implement. Designers and developers need to collaboratively evaluate the necessity of these features and their impact on the overall user experience.

In conclusion, it's important to remember that both designers and developers share a common goal: to create a user-friendly digital product. Understanding the potential pitfalls in UX design and working together to address them can result in a smoother development process and a more enjoyable user experience. Effective communication and collaboration between designers and developers are key to avoiding these common UX pitfalls and crafting a product that meets both aesthetic and functional expectations.
