More relevant than the classic chicken vs. egg debate, a question not often talked about is whether, historically, soup came before salad or if salad came before soup.

Reader, you might be thinking, obviously, soup came before salad, but I urge you to check your biases and consider the question more deeply.

Biases: When we think of historic soup, we think of peasants over a fire to keep warm. We imagine someone came in from the field with a lamb piece they traded two stones to get. It feels ancient.

When you consider a salad, you think modern, frivolous. Something you eat just for aesthetics and not for survival. Even the name has youthful connotations! Cleopatra in ‘Antony and Cleopatra’ (Shakespeare) refers to "...My salad days, / When I was green in judgment” to describe her youthful naiveté.

Incorrect Facts: Lynne Olver’s [Food Timeline](https://www.foodtimeline.org/) says the Greeks and Romans enjoyed the earliest salads. She defined a salad as mixed greens with dressing. Can we trust Lynne Oliver’s timeline though, because the Babylonians and Egyptians used oil and vinegar to dress greens, thousands of years before she claims. That sounds like a salad to me.

She also places the invention of soup around 10,000BC and states that “the history of _soup_ is probably as old as the history of cooking. The act of combining various ingredients in a large pot … was inevitable.”[1]

While it is much more challenging to define a salad and place it into context historically, one could argue that creating a salad is also the act of combining various ingredients into a large pot. If we think of a salad dressing as a kind of broth, it becomes effortless to imagine a dressed salad being enjoyed around the same time or even _before_ a soup.

Additionally, humans have cultivated and gathered greens for over 20,000 years, while we have only domesticated sheep, goats, and pigs for around 9000 (some essential ingredients to soup).

I argue that our biases about the historical longevity of soup and salad cloud an empirical investigation into this vital topic. Because it is more difficult to define a salad, I believe that historians have chosen to ignore its historical origins, and thus have chosen to ignore this question. We must demand more from our food historians.
