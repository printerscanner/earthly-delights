I’ll list out everything I knew about porcelain before my research started so we can all be on even footing. I knew porcelain was from China. I knew they made it in kilns. We call our toilets porcelain, but I wasn’t sure if it was the same material or just an expression. I knew my grandparents had porcelain stacked up in a cabinet next to the dining table. They called it “China,” and we never used it, even at Christmas. And I knew from walking through the back halls of the Louvre on free days that it fascinated European royalty. The rest, a mystery. Frankly, I’ve had a lifelong disinterest with what fascinates museums so much with clay pots.

In 18th Century Europe, I discovered, it wasn’t disinterest. It was a sickness. They called it *Die Porzellankrankheit*, or porcelain sickness. August the Strong, King of Poland, wrote to a friend, “The same is true for oranges as for porcelain, that once one has the sickness of one or the other, one can never get enough of the things and wishes to have more and more.”

While he was alive, I read, August strove to fill every room in the Zwinger Palace with porcelain. His plan was too ambitious to complete. At sixty-two, he died, with nine children from six different women and his kingdom a financial ruin, with a collection of 35,000 pieces of porcelain.

That's when I remembered that though we all live our quiet lives with a dignity that we hope will elevate us into the annals of history, the closest thing we will ever get to history is in the objects around us that only exist because of the men who had everything they could think of, and couldn't be satisfied by anything but the myths of the world. 

There are two histories of porcelain. One in China that began almost 3000 years ago, and another, stranger one that began in Europe in the 1500’s.

It's a material that has some complex material science and chemistry, but it's just these objects that have been produced in china for almost 2000 years. The Western world became absolutely captivated by it in like an almost mythic way. The book is about that the way in which we create these perversions in society. There's a bit of the Jeffery Epstein element to it. The story of porcelain is the story of the west, and our relationship with the Other, and with myths as well.

Porcelain was invented over a centuries long development period in the Shang dynasts (1600BC-1046BC). Porcelain is formed by a process of heating clay to a very high temperature, and then rapidly cooling it. When the material is rapidly cooled, instead of naturally forming into a crystalline structure, the music stops early and the material is locked into a non-crystalline state, making it super durable. This process is called vitrification, which is the transformation of a substance into a glass. In material science, glass isn't just what holds our windows together, but a classification of solids. Glasses are non-crystalline and amorphous, giving them a higher degree of connectedness than crystalline solids, making them really strong. 

In addition porcelain contains mullite, which is a rare silicate material that is formed during metamorphism of clay materials. When the clay is heated to 1400 degrees celsius, needlelike crystals form inside it that contributes to the mechanical strength of the porcelain. It also is resistant to decomposition by heat, which helps it retain its strength at high temperatures. 

The ancient Chinese produced porcelain from kaolin, (an especially white clay), and pentuse. When formed it would produce an object with a paradoxical combination of qualities -- hardness, softness, solidity and translucense. The Tang Dynasty saw the first blue and white porcelain objects, the blue color is created from is cobalt oxide, which is one of the few pigmants that can withstand high firing temperatures, which partly accounts for it's long lasting. 

Kiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of chinese pottery. The Chinese developed effective kilns capable of firing at around 1000c before 2000bc. Dragon Kilns extremely long and thin, and would have an steep interior slope of 10-15 degrees. This would allow the kiln to achieve very high temperatures, up to 1400 degrees celsius. These kilns were the technological achievement that challenged European potters, and delayed the European invention of porcelain to the 1700s. 

Chinese kilns could fire thousands of pieces of porcelain at once, so porcelain objects were not considered rare. There was lower demand in China for these pieces, and higher demand in europe so it became something almost entirely for export. By the Ming dynasty, porcelain began being made exclusively for trade. Export began in commerical shipments in southern Song dynasty around 1100.

Early trade of porcelain began with the middle east via the silk road. A Yemeni sheik collected Chinese porcelain in the 12th Century, and Porcelain shards were found in the dunes near Sana'a. 

Marco Polo in his journals gave the first western accounts of porcelain, coal, gunpowerder, paper money. Marco Polo's writings of his time on the silk road were done in collaboration with a romance writer called Rustichello of Piso. They think Polo related his memories and Rustichello wrote them down adding romances and glamor to the tales to make them more interesting. Accounts from travelers were the only information about non-western people to which europeans were exposed.

It's connection to Missionaries, to capitalism. But this mythology is created about it. exploration, learning. Marco Polo's fabricated journals.

Mythologies. Marco Polo's travels become the basis for millions including those in the modern day. That if we travel and keep a faithful journal, we will enlighten those in our home.

Through transport and travel this mythos is able to develop. The distance required, it's rareness, it's otherness is able to reveal itself. And the power the object is given by being something that comes from a great distance, and is acquired at great difficulty, considering the Chinese unwillingness to trade.

That evangelism is cut from the same cloth travelers for pleasure, photojournalist, and explorers for scientific knowledge. And that whether we give a new culture a romantic review or a critical one, it is the same act bathed in differering dieologies.

"By examining the images we hold, say, of the Chinese and Indians, we can learn a great deal about Chinese and Indians, but we mostly learn about ourselves" Issacs.

There exists within our Western bodies a shared mythology. There exists in the mythology of travel, when approaching otherness, that otherness rubs off onto you. That too see the world makes you unique.

"Self-contempt and a sense of fraudulence distinguish the attitude of contemporary self-conscious travelers. There is a touching desperation in the attempts of professional tourists, well-funded anthropologists, and recording travelers, to distinguish themsevles from the traveling masses and run-of-the-mill adventurers. The most characteristic mark of the tourist is the wish to avoid tousits and places they congregate. But this is merely evidence of the fact that travel is no longer a means of achieving distinction. It is a way of achieving and realizing a norm, the common identity we all share–the identity of a stranger."

The fall of Rome and fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans cut off trade with the east via land, so Europe began exploring sea routes. 

In February 1603, the Dutch East India Company intercepted a Portuguese merchant ship. The porcelain stolen from the ship were so valuable when they were auctioned in Amsterdam that they doubled the Dutch East India Company’s capital, and caused a stir that ignited a porcelain craze in Europe.

The Dutch East India Company was the largest company ever to have existed, the first publicly traded company, and first example of a vertically integrated global supply chain, where a company owns every aspect of the supply chain. They had a monopoly on shipbuilding, and a monopoly on goods from all over the world. Besides being a modal for our modern corporate hellscape, they did a lot positive things for cartography. 

Over 70 million pieces entered Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries and customers from London to Lisbon were desperate for more.

The Portuguese in particular wanted slaves, and thought China was the perfect place to get them. The Emperor found out this though, and attacked the Portuguese vessels. After, they were allowed some restricted trade.

China had an isolationist policies called **Haijin** or sea ban. This ban restricted private maritime trading and coastal settlement during the Ming dynasty. This ban was initially to deal with Japanese piracy, but in the 1500-1600s European missionaries and colonists began arriving via ships. The sea ban ended because of the weakness of the late Ming dynasty, not due to any sort of change of heart. The Island of Taiwan was partially under dutch rule in the 1600's. The Dutch helped usher in the Qing dynasty by cutting ties with the Ming dynasty because the Qing dynasty allowed trade.

When Portugal opened sea routes to China in 1513 it discovered porcelain pieces that ‘dumbfound the eyes’, as the Archbishop of Braga gushed in 1563. 

They called all foreign merchants “Fan Kwae,” or Foreign Devil. The Portuguese were “Se-yang Kwae,” or Devils of the Western Ocean. The Dutch were “Po-ssu-hu,” or Red Haired devils. The English were also “Red Haired” devils. Merchants from India were “White Haired” devils. The devilish French were “Fat-lan-sy.” Swedish devils were “Suy.” The Danes were “Yellow Flag” devils. Americans were “Flowery Flag” devils…

It’s understandable that the Chinese would use these terms. In 1517 the first Portuguese ship arrived in Canton, China. After dropping anchor without permission the ship’s captain ordered a broadside to be fired thinking it would impress the locals. The Chinese had no idea who these people were, but the crude display of violence was most unsettling. In 1637 the English arrived. Tired of waiting to met by Chinese officials, the English captain also decided to get everyone’s attention with a broadside.

These foreign devils courted the Celestial Kingdom tea, porcelain and money. But to get an idea what the original union meant to both parties, consider how they described each other.

And from the T’ai-wan Fu-chih, an 18th century Chinese text:

_“The people which we call Red-hair or Po-ssu-hu …live in the extreme west of the Ocean extending from Formosa…  They are covetous and cunning and have good knowledge of valuable commodities and are clever in seeking profits.  They spare not even their lives in looking for gain and go to the most distant regions to trade…  If one meets them on the high seas, one is often robbed by them…wherever they go, they covet rare commodities, and contrive by all means to take possession of the land.”_

For 500 years, the west had no idea how porcelain was made, people speculated it was made from crushed-up umbilical cords of fish that had been buried underground for decades.

Medici porcelain was the first successful attempt in Europe to make imitations of Chinese porcelain. This porcelain was called soft paste porcelain, because the low firing temperatures of European porcelain created soft ceramics. Chinese porcelain by contrast was so strong it couldn't be scratched by steel tools. 

The first attempt by the Jesuits to reach China was in 1552 by St Francis Xavier, Navarrese priest and founding member of society of Jesus. He died after 1 year on the island of Shangchuan. A french Jesuit priest named Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles was the first European who learned to manufacture porcelain, while he was in China converting people to Catholocism. Wrote a long letter describing his findings. 

At the beginning of the eighteenth century Johann Friedrich Böttger pretended he had solved the dream of the alchemists to produce gold from worthless materials. When King Augustus of Poland heard of it, he kept him in protective custody and requested him to produce gold. For years Johann Friedrich Böttger was unsuccessful in this effort, and when August realized that it was not possible for Böttger to make gold, he set him on the task of making porcelain. 

Böttger was a fraud. His biographer noted that, among other qualities, he was “negligent, forgetful, loose with money, had poor health,” and possessed “a childish demeanor.” The man who, in all likelihood, actually cracked the porcelain code for the Germans (some slight evidence exists that the English got there first) was Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, a gifted mathematician, physicist, physician, and philosopher. He was charged with supervising Böttger, who was being held captive by their king, Augustus the Strong. (Augustus thought it wise to keep an alchemist to himself, and the best way to do so was under lock and key.) Böttger had initially been resistant to the porcelain project, but he came around. The two worked together for a good five years, using two decades of Tschirnhaus’s own research. There is a hurried sense of discovery in Böttger’s existing notebook, as he records the ratios of white clay and alabaster. But just as the duo produced their first solid porcelain—a jar is described as being “half translucent and milk white, like narcissus”—Tschinhaus died. There was a robbery, papers went missing, and Böttger kept the operation going, eventually refining the formula to a level that could be reproduced and porcelain thus manufactured.

At the same time, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, a mathematician and scientist, and contemporary of Spinoza, Leibniz and Huygens experimented with the manufacture of glass, trying to make porcelain as well. Crucially, his ingredients include kaolin, the vital ingredient of true porcelain, though he was unable to use it successfully. Tschirnhaus supervised Böttger and by 1707 Böttger reluctantly started to help in the experiments by Tschirnhaus. Strong also tasked Tschirnhaus the assignment of searching the whole of Saxon territory for deposits of precious stones, while developing methods of polishing and lapping these resources.

The German discovery of porcelain production techniques was probably the most emblematic technical achievement of the Baroque period, aiming to fulfill the Baroque aesthetic opulence and the luxurious way of life of the noble class, under the economical constrants of the Mercantilist policy. - maximizing exports, minimizing imports. Modern capitalism and the industrial revolution emerged out of this shift into Mercantilism.

This quest should be considered as one of the earliest successes of modern experimental method, as outlines by Francis Bacon in the Novum Organum.

This was called Meissan porcelain. Discovered in 1708

The thin line between science and alchemy. And the mysticism at the heart of these endeavors.

This idea of alchemy, that the chemical elements of things can be manipulated and turned into great treasures that will provide endless value. It took scientists to lead by a mad crazy emperor to recreate a traditional practice, which is of interest as well. Something de Waal talks about is this idea that behind every invention, every western invention at least is a power hungry ruler looking for objects of beauty to satisfy him. Lust way.

After the preliminary trials were a success, they setup a station in Dresden, then they found clay in Erzgebirge.

Important to note that before that time it was intertwined with this idea of the philosophers stone. Something that exsisted that they wanted.

In addition to the material similarity between porcelain and the imagined Philosopher’s Stone, the workshop techniques used in producing the two substances are closely parallel.

Indeed, alchemical work in general was thought of as a passage from chaotic materiality to perfect form—a fair description of what happens in any pottery shop, as raw clays are transmuted into refined ceramic ware.


The connection between material science and alchemy. The medieval attempt to understand stuff.

Connection with chemistry. Alchemist encoded their philosophies in complicated allegories. Codewords called Dekcamen. Alchemy is the process of heating, and through the colors. Transmutation produces something including new compounds.

The distinction between alchemy and chemistry began in 1661 when Robert Boyle published is work The Sceptical Chymist. Chemists began applying the scientific method to their work.


France tried really hard to discover porcelain and discovered soft paste porcelain, but Meissen porcelain was the first to make hard paste, and it took France 50 more years to catch up. By 1760's, kaolin was discovered near Lomoges, and the Sevres factory took the lead in European porcelain design as rococo turned into what is broadly known as Louix VI style. Rococo was a feminine symbol and the daintiness of 18th century society.

A few years later, William Cookworthy, a quaker apothecary living in Devon, noticed the clay in a nearby Cornish hill resembled the kaolin described in newly published letters from China. He became the first person to make true porcelain in England. 

A cult of Chinoserie grew in England during their own porcelain manufacture development. They began to replicate and redefine elements of east asian design. Transfer printing became a popular production technique in England, resulting in the overcrowded willow patterns in the 19th Century. 

William Burton claimed that the Chinese only brought it into perfection in the 18th century. 

Porcelain was so highly desirable that it programs to attempt to imitate it stimulated manufactured consumer goods development in Europe. European countries in a practice of mercantilism wanted to limit imports and increase exports of goods, so wanted to make goods bought from Asia at home. Creating ceramics factories in europe did that.

‘Chinese porcelain was not so much the first global commodity, but the one that spread most widely, for a longer and constant period of time, in huge numbers, with the added characteristics of its endurance and impact in world culture over centuries’, say Jorge Welsh and Luísa Vinhais, the curators of _the Porcelain Room: Chinese Export Porcelain_ at the Fondazione Prada in Milan. At its peak in the 18th century, Jingzhen’s 3,000 kilns employed over a million men, women and children in an elaborate manufacturing process that anticipated modern methods of production. As Welsh and Vinhais put it: ‘Chinese export porcelain brought about ‘the birth of globalization as we know it today.’

Daniel Defoe was a former owner of a brick and ceramics factory, has is character dismissive about Chinese ceramics achievements. 

 Allach porcelain was made by Nazis using slave labor in Dachau. Hitler was obsessed with porcelain. 'He likes this porcelain, he tells me, because it is very well made. Porcelain is a very good German material. It has history. Above all, he repeats to me, it is pure.' Himmler wanted his Allach to make objects that were _künstlerisch wertvolle_ – artistically worthwhile – not degenerating into kitsch. _Deutsch sein heist klar sein_, said Hitler. “To be German is to be clear.” These ideas of purity and sorcery didn't exist in Chinese porcelain.

The Nazi's, as well as our grandmothres. Don't touch the china at grandma's house. It lives in museums. Though it's the material composition that creates purity because it can be cleaned easily, because it doesn't stain and is non porous, it's the color we latch onto, and the color that we retain. Totally opposed to the actual chinese pottery we see.

de Waal's work. white and made for shelves.

And how we see these ideas flourish in places like Nazi Germany. All of a sudden porcelain become a symbol of purity, a mythos that exists in western culture. This idea of whiteness that the chinese did not seem obsessed with.

Rarity, Jeffery Epsteins of the world. Boredom. Rareness from distance and otherness. Ultra-wealth throughout history. Jeff Bezos going into Space.

'De Waal understands what drives a person to try to make porcelain for half his life, why emperors craved it, and why kings demanded it. This level of materialism, after all, is never about necessity. “There are the pleasures of being envied and the pleasures of being feared and the pleasures of looking down on a sea of new possessions but of all the pleasures,” he writes, “More is the only thing that works.”'

We could talk about these ideas of power that have been revealed with the Jeffery Epstein case. That what underlies all of these powerful men is this overflow of lust for the unobtainable once you're given this level of power and access.

The idea of perversion being something that compels the existence of these modes of Colonization. They exist entirely to accumulate wealth, and absurd treasures.

That these wants and desires that exist inside of us are derivations of power. That the idea of a voyage is inextricably linked with missionaries, which is in itself a form of colonialism. And what is sought by those in power is in terms of wealth, this idea of other. Something that can distinguish them from others. That money has that separates them from other people. So this is a form of Memesis (Girard). This intense desire for competition exists within us.

"They may be speaking of an aesthetic value, but to what extent does this fetishization of an object and its purity reflect an idea that these men had about themselves? Porcelain is for the refined, for the ruling class, with all of its power and privilege. This is an area left largely unexplored by de Waal. He is wonderfully manic in his research; by the book’s end, he’s visited his three white hills, and he’s journeyed much further. In “The White Road,” he allows himself to get lost for weeks, to travel someplace only to return empty-handed—which makes for a true adventure and a pleasure to read. But de Waal can also be a slippery writer, disinclined to build toward a larger argument. It’s as if he prefers to spin pottery out of his words, offering one self-contained scene after another."

"For the West … China as a land in the Far East becomes traditionally the image of the ultimate Other. What Foucault does in his writing is, of course, not so much to endorse this image as to show, in the light of the Other, how knowledge is always conditioned in a certain system, and how difficult it is to get out of the confinement of the historical a priori, the epistemes or the fundamental codes of Western culture."

Western image of china as the ultimate other.

"What can furnish the West with a better reservoir for its dreams, fantasies, and utopias?

And that to even write a book about porcelain you have to address this relationship with dissecting and perverting through fantasy something that is simple. We can even discuss de Waal, or our own position. To talk about porcelain is a fetization of it. Something that has a history that exists almost entirely outside of the discourse of it's originator. Our history with the concept of the other is something that is separate from China's relationship with it. And the expansive difference of scholarship that persists and continues to persist even in modern times due to the differences in language.

Chinese scholarship done in English is done though the lens of the other, and can only reflect western ideas. Even in a modern day. Any modern interpretation of porcelain done in the english language is a reflection. And that the study of porcelain in english or though a western lens is only a study of Europe and European-ness.

It is the image of the self that appears through the mirror we call the other.

Feticism is the crudest form of religion.

The creation of the potters wheel was the most significant invention of all time because it allowed the preservation of surplus, excess. It's only when you have a surplus

Everyone wants them, most especially the rich. They are older than hell. they outlive us. we protect them over anything. We barely dare to touch them, they go in cases. we protect them in a way that we don't protect anything, not even our buildings.
