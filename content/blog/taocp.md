title: I'm considering reading "The Art of Computer Programming"

Like everyone in the engineering world, I am obsessed with Donald Knuth. To me, he represents the essential spirit of engineering and art. An email-less cowboy, he roams free in an ivory tower, spending his days in attention to one singular thing with minute detail. I, like every idiot and stereotype of bad engineering, own a copy of all his books (They are called 'The Art of Computer Programming' and if you don't know, they are quite famous). They sit on my desk in my office, and just like everyone else's copy, they are basically a very expensive paperweight. 

Every six months or so, when I am in a certain part of my menstrual cycle, I decide I am going to read the whole series cover to cover, and do all the exercises. I have lots of notes in the book from these attempts, that go all the way up to page 10, where I consistently drop off an ask myself why the hell I wanted to read these books in the first place. 

A few years back, I read my way through a big portion of the classics. That project, which probably started with some equal sense of vanity and shame, was life changing for me. Of course, those books are actually good. 
With TAOCP, once I get 10 pages in, I start to wonder if engineering has ever on any level spoken to me, or if I am just an imposter who enjoys the costumes and masks of the profession. 

When I was 19, my friend and I were pulled over on our bicycles in the middle of the night trying to illegally camp. I remember the officer being visually impressed when my friend told him he was an electrical engineering major. I think that was the reason he ended up letting us go without a ticket. The absurdity of that moment stuck out so strongly with me because my friend was failing all of his classes, and attending even fewer. (We did successfully camp in the woods after they left.)

I learned that night that the word "engineering" meant something. It is a mask that projects you from any doubt or criticism. For any readers that think I just do really bad design 24/7, I also am a programmer by trade. I do feel like I am good at it, but I constantly wonder if I am actually an analytical person. Is that even a real thing, or another myth that boys use to protect themselves. The monstrous political commentators say that men are statistically more naturally suited to the analytic world. They say that boy can focus on one topic, and I am more suited to an Austenian existence, sitting in my living room reading novels and writing about rooms with at least one woman in them. 

I looked online to see if anyone has read TAOCP all the way through. I found a series of "Part I" blog posts of ambitious software engineers (ie. men) resolving they were going to read the whole thing. Then, I found a bunch of forum posts from naive souls asking if it is a good book to use to learn computer science, and a bunch of jaded responses saying "not at all". I do have a sense that none of the jaded responders have actually read the book, because I expect if they had, it would be the very first thing they said. 

Everyone on the internet suggests not reading TAOCP and instead reading the practical Bible SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs for you nerds) instead. Both those books sound boring. I don't want to learn to code. I already know how to code, albeit very poorly. What I really want is to finish the book and for Knuth and Bill Gates [1] to pick me up on their shoulders and tell me I am a real engineer worthy of Newtons respect, that I see the world in all detail with no glazed gaps. Maybe just Knuth though, I think I might be Gates' type. 

I found one blog post from someone who actually read it. He thinks the book is meant for reading, and not for reference. He says the exercises are the most important part. That singular blog post gave me the motivation to give it a go. If I treat the whole thing like some sort of deranged art project, I think I could get through it. I have read War and Peace, Kant, Hume, why not four volumes of the most boring book of all time. The trick with the classics (especially Hume) was in finding a sick, perverse joy in it.

I talked to Dani about my idea for this project, and she rightly pointed out that my true motive might not be actually to read this book, but more that I am wondering if people can / do actually like math or if they are all just dirty liars. She said I am not going to find out the answer to that question by reading a book. That is all perfectly fair. 

But enough about me and my anxieties, and more on the great hero to us all, Knuth, the personification of the joy of the cowboy spirit, and the shining example of something I learned in art school called "paying attention". 

I'll leave you with two quotes from the beginning of the book he includes like  a sick, twisted joke, like he knows the kind of mental state a person has to be in to crack open this book and think they are going to give it a go. 

"Books are a triviality. Life alone is great."
"Woe be to him that reads but one book."

Part II is coming very very soon check your calendar. Have no worries, there will be consistent updates to this post. I just need to break down some of these mathematical formulas so I can share them with you in more detail. Bill Gates and I are both going back and forth about parts of the book that we both have definitely read.

[1] Bill Gates has a very famous quote about the book "If you think you're a really good programmer... read (Knuth's) _Art of Computer Programming_... You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing". 
Gates also claims to have read the whole thing which I do not believe.
