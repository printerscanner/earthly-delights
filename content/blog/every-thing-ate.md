**Introduction**
This project was born out of a wish I had to start making archives of unnecessary things. The experience of writing down everything I ate was weirdly moving. Looking back at these meals, I remember almost every one of them (unlike that hack Emerson). 

On January 1st, we moved the last of our things from Edinburgh to Berlin and the meal I ate that day is etched into my brain because I was up all night in a shoddy Scottish hotel room with heartburn. 

Our temporary flat in Berlin had no extra space, so we spent all of our time sitting at the two-person kitchen table. After living in Scotland, the vegetables in Berlin looked Technicolor. (I am sorry to Scotland for the hate, but we need to all admit the vegetables there are not the greatest looking, from a color perspective. You know they're really bad when you're like "Yum, German produce" too). 

Marked with asterisks are meals I referred to as "God Tier". I am not religious but these are meals where I would usually always invoke God and His glory. These meals were about more than just the food, they also affirmed your direction in life. I learned a really really good meal is rare. I am the product of a lot of mediocre food, and some rare moments of magic. 

I wanted to continue the project for the entire year, but spring came, the weather was really nice outside, and I kept forgetting to fill my notebook pages in. I would realize it had been three days, and I would have to go back into my memory and think really really hard about what I had eaten. It is almost impossible to remember everything you ate three days in the past. Your brain does not want to store that information. Eventually, I put the project down and I was feeling a lot of guilt that I didn't stick it out. Dani said to me that that was maybe part of the story of the project. If I had a chance to go back in time, I would have given myself a little more slack, and kept going even if a few days were left blank.
